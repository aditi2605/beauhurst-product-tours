Beauhurst – Product Tours Page (Take-Home Task)


Overview

This project is an improved implementation of the Product Tours page, designed to help users quickly find the most relevant walkthroughs, understand the value of the platform, and convert via a clear primary CTA.
The solution focuses on clarity, scannability, and guided discovery, while remaining responsive and lightweight.


1. Wireframe Review & UX Improvements
What works well in the original wireframe
Clear intent to showcase product tours rather than features
Strong opportunity to support both self-serve exploration and sales conversion
Content naturally suited to a scannable, card-based layout
What could be improved
The wireframe does not clearly guide different user types toward relevant tours
All tours are presented equally, increasing cognitive load
Limited context to help users quickly understand why they are seeing certain tours
Improvements made
Introduced a persona-based selector to help users self-identify their goal
Dynamically filtered tours to reduce noise and speed up decision-making
Added clear hierarchy with icons, time indicators, and “recommended” cues
Reinforced context with a dynamic label showing the selected persona

2. Helping Users Choose the Right Tour
To help users quickly find the most relevant tour:
Users start by selecting what they are trying to achieve, not a product name
Only tours relevant to that persona are shown
Tours are designed to be scannable within seconds
Time-to-complete indicators help set expectations
This approach reduces friction and supports both exploration and conversion.

3. Navigation Placement
I would place the Product Tours page:
Under “Product” or “How it works” in the main navigation
Linked contextually from the homepage hero and CTAs
This positions the page as:
A self-serve alternative to booking a demo
A mid-funnel conversion tool for users not ready to speak to sales

4. Implementation Details
Built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript
Fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop
Data-driven rendering allows easy expansion of personas and tours
Subtle animations and transitions enhance clarity without distraction
Accessibility improvements include semantic buttons and ARIA labels

Notes
This implementation focuses on UX clarity, responsiveness, and maintainable structure rather than visual complexity.
